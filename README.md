# Learning_log

The app allows users to create an account with a username and password, and then enter topics that they are interested in learning about. For each topic, users can make entries about what they are learning and save them to their account. The app uses Django to handle user authentication, data storage, and other behind-the-scenes tasks, allowing users to focus on creating their journal entries.
